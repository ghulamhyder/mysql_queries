question3: select how mnay employee in each dept make query
comment here we use count(*) and (group by) in the query for find the list of how many employee work in each dept;
query is very simple but logically
->SELECT dept,count(*) FROM emp GROUP BY dept;


 select dept from emp group by dept having count(*) <2;

: Subquery returns more than 1 row
